# Leveraging Generative AI for Enhanced Software Maintainability through Reusability

Welcome to the repository for my research project titled **"Leveraging Generative AI for Enhanced Software Maintainability through Reusability."** This research is being carried out under the guidance of **Dr. Roopak Sinha** and falls under the unit **SIT723**. The project explores how generative AI can enhance the reusability of code to improve the long-term maintainability of open-source software systems. The research aims to identify challenges in reusability and propose an AI-driven solution that can assist developers in efficiently maintaining their projects.

## Project Journey

### **Thesis Draft**
This repository includes the **Thesis Draft**, which captures the evolution of my research, from formulating the problem statement and research questions to compiling a thorough literature review. The draft outlines how reusability plays a key role in improving software maintainability and how AI can be leveraged to optimize it.

### **Literature Review**
The **Literature Review** conducted in this project explores existing frameworks, tools, and methods related to software maintainability and reusability. Through a comprehensive analysis of prior research, this review identifies key gaps in how reusability is currently approached, motivating the need for an AI-based solution.

### **Research Questions**
This project is structured around key **Research Questions** designed to address:
- The relationship between reusability and maintainability in software.
- How AI can assist developers in identifying reusable code components.
- How existing challenges in reusability can be overcome through automated solutions.

### **Proposed Solution & Architecture**
The cornerstone of this research is the **Proposed Solution**: the **Enhanced Documentation Generator**. This tool scans the codebase to generate detailed documentation of all functions, including parameters, return types, and usage examples. A key feature of the solution is the integration of a **Generative AI** tool, which allows developers to query the documentation in real-time, ensuring that reusable components are easily accessible and understood. The repository includes the **Architecture** of this solution, showcasing its design and implementation plan.

### **Research Methodology**
A robust **Research Methodology** has been followed, including both experimental and comparative methods. The project timeline, ethical considerations, and sustainability measures are all outlined to ensure the impact of this work is long-lasting.
